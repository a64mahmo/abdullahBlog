    Maaa name is abdullah! I'm a massive goof who just loves to learn about everything. Seriously, you'll see a bunch of random but cool stuff on this site that I like to talk about. Some of it is awesome (imo), and the rest is just the weird and wonderful facts I've spent way too much time reading and obsessing over. Cars, tech, random science... if it's fascinating, we're talking about it!

    I learned Java from my awesome high school teacher when I was 15, and honestly, I never looked back. if you look around you may be able to find my first ever lines of code in in the site (ill leave it up to you to find haha)
